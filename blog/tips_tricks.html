            <p><b>Throughout my argument I'll be formatting in this "Blog" through key themes. </b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>*Point 1.*</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>With the addition of another school in Dewitt Clinton many of our resources will be scarced. Not physical resources, no. We're going to be losing educational programs that are beneficial to students in the future. </p>
            <p>I've became a freelancing web developer majorly because the programs that Dewitt Clinton has offered with the STEM electives. However, because of an addition of another school I will be losing <b>MY</b> resources and future DWC students will lose their opportunity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>How is this impartial?!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>It's not impartial at all, this overlying theme of equity and impartiality is fabricated. Why are we not given an option? Why must we get resources taken from <b>US</b>.</p>
            <p>We are the only school being forced to lose resources after having such a rough past; not only does this affect our resources, but it also obstructs our growth mindset. How can we adapt to a growth mindset when everything is being taken from us. </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3><b>*Point 2*</b></h3>
            <p><b>Space is not equitable</b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Currently all schools are considered equal. That means that DWC, and ed opt school that provides access to all levels of learners and Specialized high schools who only allow the top students who ace an exam are allowed 1 classroom for every 27 students they have on their register.  This is not fair that our schools and their spaces are measured equally.  Instead, equitable would say that our schools should receive 1 classroom for every 20- 25 students, resulting in 44 classrooms allowed for a school of 1,100. 
            <p></p> 
            <p>On the other side of it, I would argue that a school like Bx Science that has top students shouldnâ€™t need smaller classroom ratios for space.  They should have 34 students for every classroom.  Meaning a school of 3,000 students should have 88 classrooms instead of 111. </p>
