            <p>Scandalism on these very streets, sketchy people walking these very streets.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Gotta quilt of a country overcoming various feats.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Walking down the streets designer headphone, beats </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Colored men, police brutality and men getting beat.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Illiteracy increase books become obsolete, how do we expect to get somewhere when reading isn't a thing.</p> 
            <p></p> 
            <p>These streets lie no liability, no trust just a huge melting pot.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Foreigners the sound of different tongues, different sounds my brain can't decipher.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>
            <p>The vibrant lights give birth to new homes and more diversity</p>

            <p>Striving to attend an Ivy league university, with diversity</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We’re all trying to leave behind the adversity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In the heart of this vibrant inner city times square where success lives on for eternity.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We’re all trying to break away from these restraints these vibrant lights give us the light to reach success</p>

            <p>God, I feel so blessed.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>These vibrant lights mark my home, these vibrant lights put on stress, but behind all these lights lies distress, here's something you don't see in the press 15.4 percent</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>15.4 percent behind these vibrant lights are homeless, always begging for a cent</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sitting down on cement tucked down and bent</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Meanwhile I'm worrying about my rent when a dollar could bless them, my anger augments</p>

            <p>Death is a “catalyst” which formed my daily intrinsic motivation and passion for computer science.
                 However, what sets me different from other people is that my motivation comes from the death of a person that I don’t know.
                  Over the summer I took part of a summer programming internship called “All Star Code”.
                   It taught me the basics and foundations of brotherhood. 
                   Not only brotherhood, but it also engraved my passion for data analyzing and computer science in general.
                    Through my six week intensive I was taught more than fundamentals, I was taught life skills which I continue to grasp. 
                    The most important lesson I learned was learning how to network, meeting different people and share my passion and dreams with them. 
                    The fuel of passion began to form when one of my All Star Code brothers died from a tragic and recent death from gun violence.
                     It motivated me to take on his dreams and passion of computer science and offer a solution to the world.
                      I convinced myself if I took on his dreams, his death wouldn’t be in vain.
                       I’ll offer a solution to this corrupt world. Not only has he given me a motivation, but he has also given me hope that I can change the world with just a touch of a finger.
                        There aren’t many digital applications that help prevent gun violence and that’s why I’m making it my initiative to create one.
                         I will not let my brothers death be in vain, which is why I continue to stir into my own path of success. </p>

            <p>The career field that I’m interested in is Computer Science, part of what sparks my interest derives from my story. I never had a passion for anything, as a kid, I was a heavy consumer into digital technology. I was so hooked onto digital technology that I became blind, my eyes would be hiding behind these thick lenses. Wearing these lenses I could see my future clearly to study computer science and seek jobs related to it. My passion for computer science came from two different sources. As I child, I was hooked onto a game called “Roblox”. You see Roblox isn’t your average kids game, it’s a generator for possibilities. You the creator are allowed to create your imagination through the powers of programming. I took advantage of that and developed games where people from different parts of the world would play. A total of three-thousand people have played my games; that’s when I struck gold. Then I quit the platform and I discovered I should continue doing something that will be beneficial towards me. Another motivational drive that pushes me to be interested in computer science is having taken part of a previous internship “All Star Code’. This internship sparked my passion the most. Each and everyday I programmed for eight hours, never have I missed a day of that internship because of how entertaining I found communicating with computers. My entertainment continues to push me to delve into computer science, it’s mostly computation and logic. It’s like speaking another language. </p>
