Sitting down on cement tuck down and bent
Meanwhile I'm worrying about my rent when a dollar could bless them, my anger augments
Behind these vibrant lights, are crimes, scandalism on these very streets
Girls being touched without consent
But I'm here learning about useless shit like a line segment.
These vibrant lights, theyâ€™re senescent
There's a deeper meaning behind these vibrant lights, these vibrant lights don't always provide a safe home.
