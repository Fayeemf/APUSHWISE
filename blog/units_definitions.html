            <p><p>The color of animals is by no means a matter of chance; it depends on many considerations, but in the majority of cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less conspicuous. Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there ought to be but few brightly colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are themselves protective. The kingfisher itself, though so brightly colored, is by no means easy to see. The blue harmonizes with the water, and the bird as it darts along the stream looks almost like a flash of sunlight. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Around this time last year, I was busy rattling away on my keyboard, applying to colleges around the globe. As I filled out the seemingly endless application in front of me, it occurred to me that this was wholly inefficient and risky.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Each year, over 2 million college applications are filed, and each of them comes with a certain element of chance. Even students of the highest academic caliber apply with an element of randomness, and often face difficult situations as a result — the intended meritocracy inherent in college admissions gives way to uncertainty, doubt, and anxiety.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Of course, many factors influence admission, but it’s no secret that two factors heavily weigh in on determining acceptance: GPA and SAT/ACT scores. While other factors are certainly taken into consideration, it is statistically and practically undeniable that these two metrics hold incredible importance to a student’s application — although no one truly knows how these are judged and filtered by colleges.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But at the end of the day, these two metrics are metrics: numbers that can be easily assessed using data science to analyze trends and relationships. And so, being extremely impatient and as anxious as I am, I decided to attempt to <b>predict college acceptance</b> rather than wait for decisions to roll out. And while there are thousands of statistical methods to analyze the trends between GPA/test scores and application outcome, I chose a recently popular predictive method: Machine Learning.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Machine Learning is a broad field with many solutions and applications, but I honed in particularly on Artificial Neural Networks. Seeing as my inputs were entirely numeric and my output could be one-hot encoded into a binary value (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted), an ANN worked out quite nicely.</p>
            <p></p>
